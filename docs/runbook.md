## How the Green Web Foundation deploys the validator


We've included the example below to demonstrate a relatively simple, repeatable deployment scenario, using Ansible for managing repeatable deploys.

We use a tweaked version of this playbook ourselves. It assumes you have a dedicated user set up to run the service running on a linux server, called `YOUR_USER`, and sets up a folder structure to run the service, using the tool `uv` to run the latest published version of the package.

It refers to a django config file accessible in the same folder as where the command is run.

It also sets up a systemd service to run the service behind a reverse proxy server like Nginx or Caddy (in our case, we use Caddy). Systemd handles restarts and failures, and collects logs to be sent to a centralised logging server.

This playbook is designed to be run from a developer's server, or as part of an internal github action in an separate "infrastructure" repository.


```yaml

- name: Deploy carbon.txt API to server and run service with systemd
  gather_facts: false

  hosts:
    # with ansible the same steps will be run on the servers listed
    # below. Adding more servers will deploy the code on more machines
    - your_chosen_webserver.your_domain.org

  remote_user: YOUR_USER

  vars:
    project_path: /var/www/carbon-txt-api.greenweb.org
    service_user: "{{ remote_user}}"
    service_restart: true

  tasks:
    - name: Set up directory for running web app
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: "{{ project_path }}"
        state: directory
        owner: "{{ remote_user}}"
        group: "{{ remote_user}}"
        mode: "0755"
      tags: [setup-script]

    - name: Upload bash script for running carbon.txt.api
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: run_carbon_txt_api.sh.j2
        dest: "{{ project_path }}/run_carbon_txt_api.sh"

      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: carbon_txt_api_config.j2
        dest: "{{ project_path }}/local_config.sh"
        mode: "0755"
      tags: [setup-script]

    - name: Upload systemd service file for running carbon.txt.api
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: systemd.carbon_txt_api.service.j2
        dest: "/etc/systemd/system/carbon_txt_api.service"
        mode: "0755"
        owner: "{{ remote_user}}"
        group: "{{ remote_user}}"
      become: true
      tags: [setup-script]

    - name: Reload systemd to pick up new changes
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        daemon_reload: true
      become: true
      tags: [systemd, config]

    - name: Query state of web app service
      ansible.builtin.service_facts:
      tags: [systemd-check]

    - name: Show state of services
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: ansible_facts.services["carbon_txt_api.service"]
      tags: [systemd-check]

    - name: Trigger restart for app with systemd
      ansible.builtin.systemd:
        name: "carbon_txt_api.service"
        state: restarted
      become: true
      when: service_restart is true
      tags: [systemd-service]
```

The carbon_txt_api file is the file run by Systemd. Every time this is run, it pulls down the latest published version of the carbon-txt package and runs the `serve` command.

It also uses a `local_config` file - this can be used to add extra configuration.

```shell
# written to /var/www/carbon-txt-api.greenweb.org/run_carbon_txt_api.sh

/path/to/bin/uv tool run carbon-txt@latest serve \
--django-settings local_config \
--port <PORT> \
--host <HOST> \
--server granian
```

The local config file is templated out into the the same directory as where the command is run from. and the same directory as the environment variables file:

```shell
# written to /var/www/carbon-txt-api.greenweb.org/local_config.py

# local_config.py

from carbon_txt.web.config.settings.production import *  # noqa

# extra settings here
EXTRA_CONFIG = True
SOME_SETTING = "some value"

```



The templated out Systemd service file looks like the example below. It uses the `run_carbon_txt_api.sh` script to run the service. Any required environment variables are placed in the `.env ` environment file.

```shell
# written to /etc/systemd/system/carbon_txt_api.service

# {{ ansible_managed }}
# Last run: {{ template_run_date }}

## Operating the front end

See the README on the [carbon-text-site github repository](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/carbon-txt-site), for instructions on developing, operating and deploying the front end that consumes the API offered by the carbon-txt validator.


## Seeing Logs

Logs from the carbon txt validator service, when deployed in Green Web Foundation infrastructure are aggregated by Systemd, and forwarded to a Loki centralised logging server. These logs can be queried at [grafana.greenweb.org](https://grafana.greenweb.org) - filter logs by the systemd unit `carbon_txt_api`, using the label filter `{unit="carbon_txt_api.service"}`.

## Monitoring, and exception tracking

We use Sentry's suite of hosted monitoring tools for tracking exceptions, performance, and uptime. See [greenweb.sentry.io](https://greenweb.sentry.io/).

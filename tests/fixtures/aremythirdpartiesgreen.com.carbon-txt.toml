# What would I like to see returned when validating this?
# For providers:
#   - Use renewables/account for emissions: { verified: true, evidence: {}, updated: dateTime }
#   - If not: { verified: false, reason: 'no data' } (or 'insuffiencent data' if that is the case).
#
# I'm honestly not sure what I'd expect to see returned for the cloud function providers.
